# 10-Steps-to-Navier-Stokes
The first 10 steps in Dr. Lorena Barba's tutorial "12 Steps to Navier Stokes", the last two steps were unavailable when I attempted this.
See Dr. Barba's tutorial [here](http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/).
Most of the code is the same as that of the tutorial, however I did make my own adjustments to animate plots over time where appropriate.
I went through this tutorial as a warmup before trying to code my own wave breaking simulator.
